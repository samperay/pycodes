# EXERCISE - ABSTRACTION AND ENCAPSULATION

# Similar to a library management system, write a program to provide layers of abstraction for a car rental system.
# Your program should perform the following:

# 1. Hatchback, Sedan, SUV should be type of cars that are being provided for rent

# 2. Cost per day:
#     Hatchback - $30
#     Sedan - $50
#     SUV - $100

# 3. Give a prompt to the customer asking him the type of car and the number of days he would like to  \
# borrow and provide the fare details to the user.

# Class = CarRentals
# Methods = displayCar, borrowCar, displayCarFare

# Class Customer
# Methods = getinputofcartype,
