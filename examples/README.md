This folder would help you to prepare some of the basic hands on practice with python. 
Some of the familiar questions would be asked in few interviews, hence these basics.

The folder is being divided into three sections, 
- **basic:** Contains simple basic programming and some of the most shortest oneliners ( Code 20>>x>>70 )
- **intermediate:** Code which has more complex conditions and logic to achieve a solution ( Code 20>>x>>50 )
- **advance:** OOO concepts & web programming.
