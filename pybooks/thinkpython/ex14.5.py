"""
Exercise 14.5. Type this example into a file named wc.py and run it as a script. Then run the
Python interpreter and import wc. What is the value of __name__ when the module is being
imported?

Warning: If you import a module that has already been imported, Python does nothing. It does not
re-read the file, even if it has changed.

If you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function reload, but it can be tricky, so
the safest thing to do is restart the interpreter and then import the module again.
