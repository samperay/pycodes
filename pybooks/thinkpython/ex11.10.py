"""
Exercise 11.9. If you did Exercise 10.8, you already have a function named has_duplicates that
takes a list as a parameter and returns True if there is any object that appears more than once in the
list.
Use a dictionary to write a faster, simpler version of has_duplicates.

"""
Exercise 11.10. Two words are “rotate pairs” if you can rotate one of them and get the other (see
rotate_word in Exercise 8.12).
Write a program that reads a wordlist and finds all the rotate pairs.
